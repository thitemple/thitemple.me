## What's on my mind

<!-- 300-800 words. This is the hook — the reason people open the email. -->
<!-- Write about whatever is real for you right now: tech, growth, building, parenting-meets-side-projects. -->
<!-- Always aim to deliver value — a lesson learned, a reframe, a practical insight. -->

_Replace this with your first "What's on my mind" piece._
