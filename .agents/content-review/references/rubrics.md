## Universal Rubrics (R1-R7)

These apply to both articles and newsletter issues.

### R1 — Voice Match

Does the content sound like Thiago? Check against the 5 voice principles from the guidelines:

1. **Conversational but precise** — Write like talking to a smart friend. No jargon for its own sake, no formality for its own sake. But not sloppy either.
2. **Personal when it serves the lesson** — Share experience when it makes the point land harder. Never share for the sake of sharing.
3. **Opinionated with receipts** — Take a position. Don't hide behind "it depends" when there's an actual opinion. But back it up.
4. **Friendly, never condescending** — Wes Bos / Josh Comeau energy. Teaching-oriented, warm, assumes intelligence.
5. **Direct over diplomatic** — Say the thing. If something is a waste of time, call it that. Kindly, but clearly.

**PASS:** The content clearly sounds like Thiago. Hits at least 4 of 5 principles.
**SOFT FAIL:** Mostly right but drifts in spots — a paragraph that gets too formal, or a section that hedges too much.
**FAIL:** Triggers any of the four anti-patterns: hustle/grind culture, corporate marketing copy, clickbait/hype, or academic/over-formal tone. Any whiff of these is automatic fail.

### R2 — Reader Test

Would "me, two years ago" find this valuable? The target reader is a developer with real experience hitting new problems — side projects, shipping solo, working in the margins. They don't need basics explained.

**PASS:** The reader would nod along and think "I've been there" or "I needed to hear this."
**SOFT FAIL:** The reader would find it somewhat useful but not specifically relevant to their stage.
**FAIL:** The piece talks down to the reader, explains obvious concepts, or addresses a problem nobody actually has.

### R3 — Value Signal

Does the piece deliver at least one of:

- (a) **Reframe** — Changes how the reader thinks about something they already do
- (b) **Actionable** — Gives the reader something concrete they can apply today

The best pieces deliver both.

**PASS:** Clear reframe AND/OR clear actionable takeaway. Reader finishes with something new.
**SOFT FAIL:** Value exists but is buried or diluted. Reader has to work to extract the insight.
**FAIL:** Reader finishes and thinks "so what?" No reframe, nothing actionable.

### R4 — No Generic Content

Apply the "generic test": could anyone have written this? The piece needs at least one of:

- A specific personal experience or example
- A named tool, project, or situation
- An opinion someone could disagree with

**PASS:** Clearly authored by someone with specific experience. Contains named tools, projects, or situations.
**SOFT FAIL:** One or two sections feel generic even though the piece overall is specific.
**FAIL:** You could swap in any author's name and the piece would read the same.

### R5 — No Self-Indulgence

Every personal anecdote must serve the lesson. Apply this test: if you remove the personal detail, does the lesson get weaker?

- If yes → the detail earns its space
- If no → the detail is indulgent

**PASS:** All personal content strengthens the teaching.
**SOFT FAIL:** One paragraph of personal content that's borderline — doesn't hurt but doesn't clearly help.
**FAIL:** More than one paragraph of personal content that doesn't strengthen the teaching. Reader thinks "why is this about you?"

### R6 — Over-Qualifying Language

Flag hedging patterns:

- "I think maybe..."
- "It's probably worth considering..."
- "In my experience, I've found that..."
- "I would say that..."
- "Perhaps..."
- "It might be..."

Rule: One qualifier per paragraph maximum.

**PASS:** Zero to minimal hedging. Statements are confident where they should be.
**SOFT FAIL:** 2-3 instances across the whole piece. Noticeable but not pervasive.
**FAIL:** 5+ instances, or hedging on the main thesis/argument. The piece sounds uncertain about its own point.

### R7 — Every Section Earns Its Space

Read each paragraph and ask: "Does this teach, reframe, or move the reader forward?"

**PASS:** Every paragraph contributes. Nothing could be cut without losing something.
**SOFT FAIL:** One paragraph that could be merged or tightened but isn't dead weight.
**FAIL:** Two or more paragraphs that don't teach, reframe, or advance. Reader skims past them.

## Article-Specific Rubrics (R8-R10)

These apply only to long-form articles.

### R8 — Front-Loaded Value

Can the reader tell what they'll get within the first 2-3 paragraphs?

Check for:

- Throat-clearing intros ("In today's fast-paced world...", "As developers, we all know...")
- Can the first paragraph be cut entirely without losing anything?

**PASS:** By paragraph 2-3, the reader knows the lesson and why it matters to them.
**SOFT FAIL:** Value arrives by paragraph 4-5. Slow start but gets there.
**FAIL:** Reader has to scroll past 3+ paragraphs with no clear indication of what the piece is about or why they should care.

### R9 — Traps Before Solutions

Does the piece name the problem or trap before jumping to solutions? This builds trust — the reader needs to feel understood before they'll accept advice.

**PASS:** The problem/trap is clearly named and the reader thinks "yes, that's exactly what happens to me" before solutions appear.
**SOFT FAIL:** Solutions come first but the piece still works because the problem is implied or briefly acknowledged.
**FAIL:** All solutions, no problem framing. Reads like a listicle of tips without context.

### R10 — Thesis Anchor

Is there at least one bold, scannable thesis statement? Something like: **"Cool tools won't ship your project."**

The thesis should be:

- Memorable and quotable
- Prominently placed (not buried in paragraph 8)
- Something the reader takes away even if they forget the details

**PASS:** Clear, bold thesis that anchors the piece. Reader could summarize the article in one sentence from this.
**SOFT FAIL:** Thesis exists but isn't prominently placed or isn't punchy enough.
**FAIL:** No clear thesis. The piece meanders without a central anchor.

## Newsletter-Specific Rubrics (R11-R13)

These apply only to newsletter issues (From the Temple).

### R11 — Three Sections Present

Does the newsletter have all three required sections:

1. "What's on my mind"
2. "Worth your time"
3. "From me lately"

**PASS:** All three sections present with meaningful content in each.
**SOFT FAIL:** All three present but one is thin (e.g., "From me lately" has only one link).
**FAIL:** A section is missing entirely.

### R12 — Curated Links Have Context

Each link in "Worth your time" needs a sentence explaining why it matters. Not "here's a link" — explain what the reader gets from clicking.

**PASS:** Every link has context that passes the "why should I click?" test.
**SOFT FAIL:** One link has weak context (e.g., just "interesting article about X").
**FAIL:** Multiple links with no context, or links that are just titles/URLs with no explanation.

### R13 — Scannable in 5 Minutes

The entire newsletter should be readable in under 5 minutes. "What's on my mind" should be a compressed insight, not a mini-article.

**PASS:** Newsletter is tight and scannable. Reader can absorb it during a coffee break.
**SOFT FAIL:** Pushing 7 minutes. "What's on my mind" runs a bit long but still works.
**FAIL:** Basically a full article crammed into newsletter format. Reader opens it and thinks "I'll read this later" (which means never).
