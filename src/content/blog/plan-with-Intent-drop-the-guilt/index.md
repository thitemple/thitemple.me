At 6:00 a.m., I sat down at my desk to work on [PartYay](https://partyay.com), hoping for a quiet morning of coding. At 6:20 a.m., my three‑year‑old woke up. “Blip,” I thought. The next day I set 5:30 a.m.; he was up at 5:50 a.m. Fine—5:00 a.m.; at 5:30 a.m. he yelled, “Daddy!” Eventually it settled: I’m up at 5:00 a.m., he’s up around 6:30 a.m., and I get about 90 minutes. Not hero hours. Just holding the intent and finding the window reality allows.

I’m a parent building on the margins—before work, after bedtime. What keeps me moving: I plan the week on purpose, forgive the daily chaos, and judge success by the small wins I log—not by perfect adherence.

That combo matters because it cuts guilt without letting me drift. A plan is a map; weekly wins are mile markers. Life with kids will blow up any minute‑by‑minute fantasy; measuring progress weekly keeps me accountable without pretending the week will be tidy.

The traps are familiar:

- Parents beat themselves up for missing the plan and imagine they’d crush it in a quieter universe.
- They ignore the rest of their lives and try to brute‑force through it.
- They compare their pace to people with totally different constraints and feel behind for no good reason.

**Plan with intent, drop the guilt, count the wins.**

Story two—because my son always wants two books. I was listening to [The Knowledge Project with Harley Finkelstein](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/harley-finkelstein/) about being intentional with a color‑coded calendar—as he puts it—roughly—“Show me your calendar and I’ll tell you who you are.” I spent thirty minutes mapping my evenings: blocks for ideation, chores, writing. Night one, five minutes into _ideation_, the nine‑month‑old woke. First reaction: frustration. Then the reframe: I’m doing this for them. I settled him, came back, and didn’t throw out the plan or myself—I just picked up where I could and logged what moved.

## I log one small win each week

- I journal 5–10 minutes a day. I highlight what I touched—code, notes, even a tiny refactor—and at the end of the week I summarize the handful of things that moved.
- If a day goes sideways, the weekly view still shows momentum. That’s what I judge.

## I time‑block my week, then forgive the day

- I plan my evenings and mornings in the calendar (colors optional). The blocks tell me what “now” is for.
- When a kid wakes mid‑block, I don’t scrap the week. I return and continue with the next step I wrote down. Plans guide me; they’re not contracts.

## I treat my schedule as choices

- If it’s not scheduled, it’s a deliberate “not now,” not failure. That keeps me from feeling behind for things I intentionally parked.
- Family, sleep, and work have weight. The calendar reflects that on purpose.

## I stop comparing my pace

- Other people have different constraints. I try not to benchmark my pace against theirs.
- Instead, I look at what I did with the time I had this week and count those wins.
